<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello and nice to meet you. My name is Tabbie.</p>

<p>My journey towards becoming a webdeveloper is fueled by a few factors some of them being;
  <ol>
  <li>A desire to challenge myself beyond my normal comfort zones</li>
  <li>To acquire a new skill</li>
  <li>To get job opportunities</li>
  <li>To prove to my sons anything is possible</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Everytime a new concept is introduced ,some fear kicks in, but I breathe in, breath out and listen to my instructor Angela.
  Sometimes on repeat till I grasp what she is teaching. She has assured us it will get tough,and what I think about that is ..well 
  that's what am here for ...a challenge and above all to face it and conquer it. So see you on the other side of victory. Cheers!
